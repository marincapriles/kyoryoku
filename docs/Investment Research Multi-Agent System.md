        # Coordination phase
        conflicts = self.identify_conflicts(results)
        consensus = self.build_consensus(results, conflicts)

        # Decision phase
        recommendation = self.synthesize_recommendation(consensus)
        return recommendation

    def identify_conflicts(self, results):
        # Find where agents disagree
        # Quantify confidence levels

    def track_prediction_accuracy(self, prediction, actual_outcome):
        # Track which agent predictions were most accurate
        # Adjust agent confidence weighting
        # Identify systematic biases
        pass

    def process_user_feedback(self, recommendation, user_action):
