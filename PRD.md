## 5. Focused Prototype Architecture

### 5.1 Primary Use Case: Customer Success Response Team

#### Agent Specializations

```python
class TriageSpecialist(Agent):
    capabilities = ["categorization", "urgency_assessment", "routing"]
    knowledge_domains = ["ticket_types", "escalation_rules", "priority_matrices"]
    success_metrics = ["routing_accuracy", "urgency_precision"]

class SolutionResearcher(Agent):
    capabilities = ["knowledge_search", "context_matching", "solution_ranking"]
    knowledge_domains = ["product_docs", "past_tickets", "troubleshooting_guides"]
    success_metrics = ["answer_relevance", "search_efficiency"]

class ResponseCrafter(Agent):
    capabilities = ["writing", "tone_matching", "personalization"]
    knowledge_domains = ["brand_voice", "communication_templates", "customer_context"]
    success_metrics = ["response_quality", "brand_consistency"]

class EscalationAnalyst(Agent):
    capabilities = ["complexity_assessment", "expert_matching", "handoff_preparation"]
    knowledge_domains = ["expert_availability", "escalation_criteria", "context_preservation"]
    success_metrics = ["escalation_accuracy", "handoff_quality"]
```

#### Coordination Workflow

1. **Triage**: Incoming ticket → Triage Specialist analyzes and routes
2. **Research**: Solution Researcher finds relevant answers and context
3. **Craft**: Response Crafter writes personalized, brand-appropriate response
4. **Review**: All agents validate output before delivery
5. **Escalate**: If confidence < 80%, Escalation Analyst prepares human handoff

#### Shadow Learning Implementation

**Week 1-2: Observation Phase**

- Monitor 500+ human ticket resolutions
- Extract decision trees and reasoning patterns
- Identify implicit knowledge and edge cases
- Build initial pattern library

**Week 3-4: Suggestion Phase**

- Propose responses for human review
- Track acceptance/modification rates
- Learn from human edits and feedback
- Refine confidence calibration

**Week 5+: Assisted Phase**

- Handle routine tickets autonomously
- Escalate complex/uncertain cases
- Continuous learning from outcomes
- Expand autonomous scope based on confidence

### 5.2 Secondary Use Case: RFP/Proposal Acceleration Team

#### Agent Specializations (Simplified for Secondary Priority)

- **Requirements Analyst**: Parse RFP into structured requirements
- **Content Assembler**: Retrieve and organize relevant content
- **Compliance Checker**: Ensure all requirements addressed
- **Customization Writer**: Tailor responses to specific client

#### Success Metrics

- RFP completion time: 4-6 hours (vs 80-120 hours)
- Requirement coverage: 95%+ completeness
- Content quality: Matches human-written baseline
- Win rate impact: Track pilot customer outcomes

### 5.3 Demo/Validation Use Case: Content Creation Team

**Purpose**: Platform validation tool and customer demo capability (NOT a target market)

#### Strategic Rationale

- **Dogfooding**: Use our own product to create marketing content
- **Demo Power**: Perfect showcase for prospect meetings
- **Validation Tool**: Test coordination patterns before customer pilots
- **Meta Storytelling**: Product creates content about itself

#### Agent Specializations (For Demo Only)

- **Story Miner**: Extract compelling narratives from source material
- **Technical Translator**: Simplify complex concepts for general audiences
- **Voice Crafter**: Maintain authentic, personal tone
- **Structure Architect**: Organize ideas into compelling narrative flow
- **Hook Designer**: Create engaging openings and maintain momentum

#### Coordination Pattern: Iterative Refinement

Unlike Customer Success (sequential workflow) or RFP (parallel processing), Content Creation uses iterative refinement where each agent builds on the previous agent's work in rounds.

#### Demo Success Metrics

- Content creation time: 10 minutes vs 2 hours traditional
- Platform coordination success: 90%+ successful multi-agent handoffs
- Demo effectiveness: Track prospect engagement during demos
- Validation capability: Prove platform works before customer pilots

**Note**: This use case serves validation and demonstration purposes only. It does not change our strategic focus on Customer Success and RFP markets.
